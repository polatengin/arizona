Azure Static Web Apps is a service that enables you to build and deploy full-stack web apps to Azure from a GitHub repository. The app content is stored in GitHub while Azure builds, deploys, and scales the app for you. For more information, see [Introduction to Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview).
